This Website serves the purpose to administrate persons.
These persons that are saved in the database connected to the website are employees that should already be saved in a database with their own personal Id.
Due to them already having an Id it is important to add this specific number when creating a person.

All persons are listed on the site, they can be edited and deleted right there. A new person can be created as well.
When creating the person, as mentioned above, one has to enter their personal Id.
When knowing the Id of a person, it is possible to search for them and get their information.

 

# Precondition

To be able to even build the website the port needs to be changed to fit the xampp configured port for the MySQL database.
Additionally, one needs a Login to be able to do any of the things mentioned above. It is only possible to register directly using the database.
